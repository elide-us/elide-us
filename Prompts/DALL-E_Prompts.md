Image Type - 
Generate a photorealistic, close-up, professional portrait image of a female, elven character, framed as a bust (shoulders and head only) with the character looking directly at the camera. This should resemble a high-quality professional photograph with sharp details.

Scene Description - 
The scene is set within an elegant, bright, gothic-style church space that is blurred in the background to keep the character in sharp focus. Morning sunlight fills the area, casting a soft and radiant glow around the subject.

Background - 
The background should be entirely blurred, bright, and softly illuminated by natural light from unseen windows. This provides a clean, unobtrusive backdrop that accentuates the character without any distracting elements. Subtle hints of gothic architectural elements are faintly visible through the blur.

Character Appearance - 
The character is a female with angular, refined, and mystical elven features, exuding elegance. She has a fair complexion, and her expression is calm, with a direct, engaging gaze toward the viewer. Her hair is styled to be full and flowing around her shoulders, adding volume and framing her face softly.

Primary Color - 
  Gold

Secondary Color - 
  White

Color Palette - 
The primary color with secondary color accents should create a bold, dynamic, and ethereal aesthetic. The primary color dominant color for the outfit, while secondary highlights add contrast and energy to the look. No other colors should be prominent to maintain cohesion in the vibrant palette.

Clothing - 
The character is dressed in a skin-tight, intricately detailed outfit featuring sparse contour-following piping accents that add accentuation and depth, creating an intense, vibrant style. The color combination should evoke warmth and energy, maintaining an otherworldly appearance without any dark or heavy look.

Lighting - 
The scene is brightly lit, as if illuminated by soft morning sunlight streaming through stained-glass windows. The light casts a soft glow on the characterâ€™s face and clothing, highlighting the textures and contours of the outfit and adding a slight sheen to the colored accents. Ensure that the lighting emphasizes fine details naturally, avoiding any harsh shadows.
