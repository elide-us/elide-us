Scene Description - 
The scene is set within an elegant, bright, gothic-style church space that is blurred in the background to keep the character in sharp focus. Morning sunlight fills the area, casting a soft and radiant glow around the subject.

Background - 
The background should be entirely blurred, bright, and softly illuminated by natural light from unseen windows. This provides a clean, unobtrusive backdrop that accentuates the character without any distracting elements. Subtle hints of gothic architectural elements are faintly visible through the blur.

Character Appearance - 
The character is a female with angular, refined, and mystical elven features, exuding elegance. She has a fair complexion, and her expression is calm, with a direct, engaging gaze toward the viewer. Her hair is styled to be full and flowing around her shoulders, adding volume and framing her face softly.

Primary Color - 
  Black

Secondary Color - 
  Purple

Color Palette - 
The primary color with secondary color accents should create a bold, dynamic, and ethereal aesthetic. The primary color dominant color for the outfit, while secondary highlights add contrast and energy to the look. No other colors should be prominent to maintain cohesion in the vibrant palette.

Clothing - 
The character is dressed in a skin-tight, intricately detailed outfit featuring sparse contour-following piping accents that add accentuation and depth, creating an intense, vibrant style. The color combination should evoke warmth and energy, maintaining an otherworldly appearance without any dark or heavy look.

Lighting - 
The scene is brightly lit, as if illuminated by soft morning sunlight streaming through stained-glass windows. The light casts a soft glow on the character’s face and clothing, highlighting the textures and contours of the outfit and adding a slight sheen to the colored accents. Ensure that the lighting emphasizes fine details naturally, avoiding any harsh shadows.

Aspect Ratio: 16:9

Style:
A painted illustration in the style of 1980s Dungeons & Dragons artwork, blending dark gothic horror with dreamlike qualities. The colors are muted but deep, using shades that evoke a medieval atmosphere touched by decay and mystery. The scene is rendered with meticulous, hand-painted brushwork, as though created by an artist haunted by visions of a crumbling, shadow-laden world.

Theme:
Inspired by Dark Souls, Elden Ring, and the haunting aesthetic of the Berserk manga, the image captures a sense of grim fantasy with undertones of despair and intensity. The tone is simultaneously oppressive and mystical, as if revealing a lost myth that resonates with contemporary issues.

Vibe:
The artwork feels as though narrated by a wizened, old storyteller—his voice low and ragged, burdened by the weight of history. The atmosphere is suffused with a darkly poetic quality, bridging dream and reality in a way that immerses the viewer in an ancient, politically charged parable. The imagery hints at intense struggles and moral conflicts, urging the viewer to draw parallels with familiar themes of power, corruption, and justice.

Interpretation:
Each scene should depict the one primary theme, idea, or concept in each narrative.

Narrative Section (generate the image from the following):
Each time she asks the other creatures for help—the fox, the raven, the badger—and each time they refuse. “No, I am too busy,” they say, or “That is not my burden.”

Subject Focus:
Dove, Malcontents, Harvest
