# V. Setting and Anthopy

The Realms of Prism today are seven. But it was not always so.

In the time before, all realms were unified, existing together in harmony. Magic flowed freely, and the elements intertwined, creating a world of balance and unity. But this era of oneness came to a violent end with the rise of the Lonely Muse, whose relentless pursuit of power and truth threatened to unravel the very fabric of the universe.

To stop her and to preserve reality itself, the Prism was shattered. The **Titans**, led by the wisdom of the **First Titan**, made the choice to divide the world, creating a new order to contain the Muse’s power. Each realm was given its place in this new, fragmented reality, organized according to the very design of magic itself.

In the beginning, there was only light. Endless, pure, and unbroken. No land, no sky, no stars, no living thing—only the **Titans**, colossal entities tasked with shaping the universe, their purpose hidden deep within the radiant brilliance. The light was everything: the source of all, the fount of knowledge, the beacon of creation.

Among these Titans, there was one who dared to gaze deeper into the light, yearning to uncover its wisdom, to dissect it and extract its ultimate truth. This Titan, driven by an insatiable hunger to understand the light’s secrets, ventured beyond the radiance—beyond the comfortable glow of creation. The Titan sought the core of all knowledge, believing that within the light lay all answers.

But what the Titan discovered was not enlightenment. As the Titan delved deeper into the spectrum, the light began to fragment, and something else was revealed. There, at the edge of creation, lurked the **chaos of the universe**, untamed and wild. The spectrum, split apart into colors never before seen, burst open a realm of terrifying disorder, one where the laws of reality unraveled. **Orange**, the color of chaos, flickered violently—a force of transformation that twisted the very fabric of existence.

And from within that chaos came the unimaginable: **death**. Not just the ending of life but the birth of something far darker, something beyond understanding. **Black**, the void where the light could not reach, where not even death existed as we know it, but rather the absence of everything. A place of nothingness, cold and unfeeling.

The Titan, seeking wisdom, had uncovered the **anarchy of free will**. The Titan had expected truth, but instead, **chaos** and **void** descended. In an instant, reality itself lashed back. The Titan, once a being of unimaginable power, was struck down. The very force of death, newly born, tore through the Titan's immortal form. But death—though it claimed the Titan—could not complete its task, for a Titan is not of this world. Not truly alive, but also not truly dead.

The Titan’s body shattered, its form twisted by the chaos it had uncovered. What was once a singular being was now two—two forces created from the remnants of its divine essence. **Orange**, the chaotic, writhing energy, now lived as a school of magic, a manifestation of the universe's capacity to destroy and recreate. It was **transformation**, birthed from the pieces of a god that were too stubborn to die.

And from the pieces that had died, from the remnants that crumbled and decayed, there came the first **undead**, a hollow shell bound to the void. This was **Black**, the magic of death and void, a force that would haunt the world as the embodiment of the Titan’s death—a death that could never fully come.

The first Titan had sought wisdom in the light but had instead unleashed the twin forces of chaos and death, giving birth to the **Orange** and **Black** schools of magic. And so, from that day forth, the light would never again be whole, for the discovery of its spectrum had forever split creation into opposing forces. And thus, the universe knew death, chaos, and the eternal void.

---

In the aftermath of the First Titan’s fateful discovery, the cosmos trembled, for the world had learned chaos, and it had learned death. The light, once unbroken, now fractured into the **Prism**, revealing realms of magic both fearsome and misunderstood. Yet even as death and chaos spread their shadow across the universe, the Titans did not despair. They knew that to survive, to shape the universe as it was meant to be, they must confront what had been unleashed.

In shock, the remaining Titans gathered. The strongest and wisest among them, drawn by the gravity of their shared fate, formed a **council**. At its head stood the First Titan—though death had torn them apart, it still lived, his form marked by the chaos she had touched, their presence shadowed by the void. And yet, it was no longer simply a victim of these forces. He had mastered them. The very energies that had undone her now resided within, and from this place of hard-won wisdom, they led the council with the gravest caution.

“We must understand what we have seen,” he said, our voice echoing through the stars, “and we must not err again. The light is far more than we knew. It is a **Prism**, and we must learn its edges with care.”

The council, now guided by this profound understanding, turned its gaze back toward the Prism. They moved with a new respect, a tempered resolve. The light was not to be fully opened again, not recklessly, not like before. They would peel away the layers gently, searching for the other truths hidden within. And so, from the **death** they had uncovered, they found its counterbalance: **life**.

Life emerged, not as a distant idea but as a force in its own right. It did not rise in the heavens but was born from the **ground**, from the foundation of existence itself. The **earth**, firm and fertile, became the cradle of life. **Green**, the school of **Earth and Life**, took shape—rich, profound, and unyielding. The Titans felt its weight, its promise, for it was from this soil that all things would grow. Life would spring forth, reborn from the death that had preceded it. Here, in this profound balance, the Titans saw the strength of renewal. It was the essence of the **Green** school, a reminder that even in the shadow of death, life finds a way to bloom.

But from **chaos**, there was yet more to uncover. The Titans turned their attention upward, to the skies, and there they discovered the unpredictable, volatile power of **air** and **lightning**. **Yellow**, the school of **Air and Lightning**, was born from the crackling energy that surged through the heavens, the roaring winds and electric storms that tore through the firmament. It was wild, potent, and chaotic, but not without purpose. The sky itself was a force of life—dynamic, ever-changing, and full of potential. The Titans learned the might of this force, recognizing in it the unshakable will of **Courage**. The chaos that birthed it was no longer a mindless force but one that drove the air to shape the heavens.

Thus, from the depths of **Green**, life rooted in the **earth**, and from the heights of **Yellow**, storms raged with purpose. These two schools were unlike death and chaos, yet they were **synergized with the light**. They were born not of destruction but of creation and transformation. They were part of the Prism’s natural order, connected intimately to the White, each a reflection of its careful balance.

And so, the **Titans**, having learned from the folly of their first discovery, cautiously extracted these truths from the Prism. With great wisdom, they now understood that the edges of the Prism could be explored, if only with patience and care. And so, the schools of **Green** and **Yellow** were born—firmament and soil, sky and earth, life and air, the powers of renewal and storm that would forever shape the universe.

Wrong color version:

As the Titans’ curiosity deepened, they realized that the universe was still unbalanced. Though they had uncovered the powers of life, earth, air, and lightning, there were two more colors waiting within the Prism—**sympathetic colors**, just outside the edges of what they had already discovered.

First, from the edge of **Green (Earth and Life)**, they found **Red (Fire and Blood)**. It was the flame, the pulse, the beating heart of life. In so many ways, it stood in opposition to life, but the Titans saw its necessity. The **soil**, rich and fertile, needed the **blood** of life to sustain itself. And while **life** grew from the earth, **fire** brought both destruction and rebirth. **Red** balanced the equation, for the **blood** of life flowed from the earth, and fire gave warmth and strength to all things. Thus, from the depths of **Green**, the Titans found **Red**, the magic of fire, blood, and power.

But the Titans were not finished. Beside **Yellow (Air and Lightning)**, they sensed another sympathetic force—one tied closely to the air itself. In the skies, within the chaos of storms, they found **Water**. **Blue (Water and Illusion)**, they realized, was born of the air, hidden within the clouds, and for the first time, **rain** fell upon the earth. Water, fluid and reflective, brought a new kind of magic: **Illusion**, the unseen, the hidden truths that danced like reflections on the surface of a stream. **Blue** flowed through the air, from cloud to earth, nourishing life as the **rains** poured down for the first time.

With these final discoveries—**Red** and **Blue**, fire and water—the Titans felt the Prism had revealed all it needed to. There was **balance** now, between life and death, between chaos and order, between fire and water. The universe was complete. And so, the Titans ceased their explorations, content with what they had uncovered. They left the magic of the **Prism** to flow through the realms, allowing **life** to flourish, nourished by the balance they had restored to the universe.

Regenerated too verbose version:

As the Titans searched for balance within the Prism, they knew their discoveries were incomplete. There were still forces within the universe waiting to be revealed, tied to the colors that lay beyond what they had already found. They recognized that to maintain balance, they had to explore opposite sides of the spectrum they had uncovered. It was not enough to have only life and death, or chaos and order—they needed to draw from both sides to find the equilibrium they sought.

Looking first to the realm of **Green (Earth and Life)**, the Titans understood that **life** needed a counterbalance. From the depth of the **earth** emerged **Red (Fire and Blood)**. Though life and fire seemed opposed, the Titans saw the truth: **life** could not exist without **blood**, and the earth itself could not be reborn without the purifying heat of **fire**. **Red**, which now rested beside **Yellow**, was the force of vitality, strength, and destruction. **Fire** was as essential to **life** as the soil from which it sprang, creating a perfect harmony between the two. 

From the **Yellow (Air and Lightning)** school, the Titans then sought its counterpart, and they found it in the **Blue (Water and Illusion)**. **Water**, carried by the winds and found in the clouds, brought the **rains** that nourished the earth. But **Blue** was more than just water—it was the power of **Illusion**, the fluid, ever-shifting nature of reality. Just as the **winds** and **lightning** tore through the skies, **water** flowed and changed, creating a delicate balance between the chaotic forces of the air and the steady, reflective nature of water.

Thus, from both sides of the septagram, the Titans uncovered the last two schools. **Red** and **Blue**, derived from **Green** and **Yellow**, completed the spectrum. This ensured the balance they had sought from the start.

With this perfect balance established, the Titans believed their task was complete. Life could now flourish in the universe, guided by the harmony of all seven colors of the Prism.

After the Prism’s balance was found, the Titans, satisfied with their creation, retreated into a deep rest, and from the quiet of their slumber, the first generation of mortals emerged. These beings, nearly immortal in their nature, were long-lived, their lifespans stretching out like the lifespans of trees and mountains. They were not mere mortals but **spirits**, birthed from the harmony of **light, air, and soil**, infused with the essence of the Prism itself. From **White**, they carried the light of wisdom and prophecy; from **Yellow**, the breath of the skies and the spark of life; and from **Green**, the nurturing soil that gave rise to the forests and mountains.

Thus, the **world of Prism** was born—vast, beautiful, and peaceful, a world shaped by the careful hands of these eternal beings. They wandered the valleys, shaped the fields, and raised the mountains to the sky. The **forests** grew tall, thick with life, and the **rivers** flowed with pristine waters, untouched by chaos or destruction. In this serene world, there was no need for haste or conflict. The landscapes of Prism were lonely, but they did not long for more. To these beings, it was enough to be **one with the Light**, to live in peace and harmony with the world they had crafted.

These creatures, who were born from the **essence of the Titans**, learned the nature of **magic**. It was a quiet, subtle force that flowed through the world, drawn from the colors of the Prism. They wielded it not for power or domination, but to enhance the beauty of their world. With the magic of **White**, they filled each dawn with radiant light. With **Yellow**, they shaped the winds and guided the storms, bringing fresh rains to nourish the soil. And with **Green**, they tended the forests and fields, ensuring that all life flourished in harmony.

Every **dawn** was a spectacle of vibrance and beauty, a gift from these peaceful beings. They lived in communion with the world, their magic woven into the fabric of reality itself. Though they lacked nothing, and though they did not yearn for what was absent, they still felt that the world was not yet complete. Yet, in their hearts, they were content. They knew that being part of the **One**, the **Light**, was enough.

For ages and eons, they crafted their world in harmony, their lives an eternal dance with the elements of the Prism. And so the world of Prism stood, a testament to peace, beauty, and balance, awaiting the day when the final colors of the Prism would be revealed. But for now, they rested in the light of creation, basking in the joy of what had been made.

---

After millennia of crafting the world with light, life, and endless beauty, a deep longing stirred once more in the hearts of the children of the Titans. No longer content with merely basking in the light and shaping the perfect world of **Prism**, they felt the pull of something greater—the need for **balance**. Though the world flourished in peace and harmony, they sensed a void, a missing force that could not be ignored. They needed the **fire** of creation, the **water** of life, the **blood** that coursed through living veins, and the **ever-changing forms** of new life to bring the world into balance.

From the waters, the **younglings** were brought forth—**mortals**, with lifespans as fleeting as the wind. These short-lived beings were the antithesis of the eternal ones, but they held within them a spark of something new, something vital. The mortals were fragile, **short of life**, yet **filled with vigor** and **passion**. Though their existence was often brutal, marked by the need for shelter, sustenance, and survival, they also possessed a fierce **love** for life. They walked alongside the Eternal Ones, learning from their ancient wisdom and basking in the magic of the world.

The mortals were taught the nature of **fire**, the cleansing and the destructive. They learned the mysteries of **water**, the force of transformation and illusion. They became **children of the elements**, mastering **earth** beneath their feet and **air** that carried them forward. They were born into a harsh world but discovered beauty, even in their suffering. They formed the **infant steps** of **civilization**, learning to build, to defend, to grow, and to love. From these earliest generations, there emerged **valor**, **loyalty**, **courage**, and **wisdom**—embodiments of the traits the children of the Titans had once embodied themselves.

But with the passage of **millions of years**, the world of the mortals began to change. The Eternal Ones withdrew from the mortal world, retreating into quiet obscurity. The stories of their presence faded into myth. Mortals, in their short, brutal existence, mastered the realms of **earth, air, fire, and water**, growing strong, building civilizations, and living lives of fleeting beauty. Yet, they **forgot** the Titans, and they **forgot** the children of the Titans, who had shaped the world in the beginning.

All that remained were the forces the Titans had unleashed: **magic** and **mortality**. The once-immortal beings faded from memory, and with them, the connection to the ancient balance of the Prism. Mortals built their own worlds, their own stories, but even as they advanced, even as they mastered magic and the elements, they sensed something **missing**. Something vital had been lost from their existence—a sense of purpose that transcended even their greatest achievements.

Thus, the **First Age of the Immortals** came to an end. The Titans and their children faded into legend, leaving behind only the echoes of their creations and the powerful magic that flowed through the world. But even in this age of mortality, the world waited. The Prism had more yet to reveal, and though the Titans slept, the forces of the universe would stir once more, in time.
