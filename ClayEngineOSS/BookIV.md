# IV. Magic System Design

The magic system in Prism is as much a story of magic as it is the story of the world itself.

The world of Prism is split into seven realms, each directly tied to one of the seven schools of magic.

The story of the world tells how magic was created.

Each of the Schools is associated with a philosophy:

**White - School of Light and Prophecy**
  - Wisdom vs Cunning

**Yellow - Air and Lightning**
  - Courage vs Hubris

**Red - Fire and Blood**
  - Valor vs Passion

**Orange - Chaos and Transformation**
  - Liberty vs Anarchy

**Blue - Water and Illusion**
  - Clarity vs Truth

**Green - Life and Earth**
  - Patience vs Dominance

**Black - Death and Void**
  - Sacrifice vs Control
