# IV. Magic System Design

Our game's magic system offers a dynamic, flexible spellcasting experience built on a procedural framework without static spells. Players input magical words—**nouns**, **verbs**, **adjectives**, **adverbs**, and **shapes**—to express their intent, which the server interprets to generate real-time interactions.

### **Core Mechanics**

Every interactive object in the game world is assigned a magical name (**noun**) that defines its nature and how it can be manipulated. For example, a fire elemental responds to **"Flam"** (Fire), while a stone wall reacts to **"Terra"** (Earth).

Spells are crafted by combining nouns with verbs and modifiers. For instance, **"Vas Flam Rectus"** translates to **"Greater Fire in a Straight Line"**, manifesting as a firewall. The server interprets these inputs along with player actions to determine spell effects.

### **Spell Research and Creation**

Players cannot cast spells by simply inputting words in real time; they must first **research and create** spells. This involves discovering valid combinations of magical words to form functional spells, which are then **memorized** for later use. This process encourages exploration and careful crafting of spells. For example, to cast **"Vas Flam Rectus"**, a player must first research and validate this combination within the game mechanics.

### **Multiple Paths to the Same Effect**

Different magic schools can achieve similar results through their unique themes. To extinguish a flame:

- A **Red Magic** mage might use **"Ex Flam"** (*Banish Fire*).
- A **Black Magic** practitioner could cast **"In Umbra"** (*Create Shadow*) to smother it.
- A **Blue Magic** user might employ **"In Aqua"** (*Create Water*) to douse the fire.

This allows players to solve problems in ways that align with their magical affinities, promoting diverse gameplay experiences.

### **Interaction with the World**

Each spell follows an order of operations:

1. **Core Effect:** Determined by nouns and verbs.
2. **Modifiers:** Adjectives and adverbs adjust characteristics like intensity and duration.
3. **Shape Definition:** Shapes like **"Rectus"** (Straight Line) or **"Spiralis"** (Spiral) define spatial interaction.

This system ensures consistent processing and limitless possibilities, while requiring players to research and validate spells for balance.

### **The Constructor Kit Philosophy**

Embracing a **constructor kit** approach, we empower players and Dungeon Masters to shape almost every aspect of the game world:

- **Crafting:** Players use procedural tools to create unique weapons and armor.
- **NPC Behavior:** Customizable modules and animations allow NPCs to interact in unique ways.
- **Environmental Interaction:** Players influence how NPCs and objects engage with the environment, leading to dynamic gameplay.

By fully embracing procedural generation, we offer endless possibilities for creativity and experimentation, allowing players to shape their ever-evolving world.

The magic system is built on **Words of Power**, which allow players to cast spells, interact with objects, and shape the world using a combination of **nouns**, **verbs**, **adjectives**, **adverbs**, and **shapes**. These words form the core of how players interact with the game’s magical systems, and their combinations create diverse spell effects and interactions.

### **Shapes**

Shapes are an integral part of spellcasting, defining how the magic interacts with space and direction. As mages advance in their mastery of the magical schools, they gain access to additional shapes through the synergy system, unlocking more complex and powerful spellcasting potential.

- **At the 4th ring**, a mage gains access to the two shapes from their synergy schools. These are the schools adjacent to their primary school in the synergy cycle. For example, a mage specializing in **White (Life Magic)** would gain access to the shapes of **Yellow (Lightning Magic)** and **Green (Nature Magic)** at the 4th ring.

- **At the 7th ring**, mages unlock access to the shapes from the synergy schools of their secondary schools. Continuing the **White (Life Magic)** example, at the 7th ring, the mage would gain access to the shapes of **Red (Fire Magic)** and **Blue (Water Magic)**.

- **Black (Death Magic)** is unique in that it does not participate in this synergy system. Instead, Black mages have special gameplay mechanics that allow them to unlock shapes through other means, maintaining their distinct approach to magic.

In the full synergy cycle—**White -> Yellow -> Red -> Orange -> Black -> Blue -> Green**—Black is excluded from the ring-based synergy progression. For example, an **Orange (Chaos Magic)** mage would gain access to the shapes of **Red (Fire Magic)** and **Blue (Water Magic)** at the 4th ring, bypassing Black entirely.

## Combat Mechanics

Some spells will have one or more of the following effects. These are the primary combat mechanics impacting effects, which may be called different things in each school.

### Counter Physical Capabilities

- **Root** (cannot move)

  This effect causes the target to stop all movement. While rooted, the target can still cast spells but cannot move from their position for a period of time.

- **Snare** (move slowly)

  This effect reduces the target’s movement speed. They will move at a slower maximum speed for a period.

- **Slow** (attack speed reduction)

  This effect decreases the target's animation speed. Attacks and recovery actions take longer to execute for a period.

- **Expose** (reduced physical defenses)

  This effect lowers the target's physical defenses, causing physical damage to be mitigated to a lesser degree.

### Special Cases

- **Poison / Disease** (damage over time)

  This effect inflicts damage on a periodic basis until cured. The damage can vary based on the potency of the poison or disease.

- **Stun** (interrupted, frozen)

  This effect causes the target to halt all actions, including movement and casting. They are unable to move or cast spells for a period.

### Counter Magical Capabilities

- **Silence** (cannot cast)

  This effect prevents the target from casting spells that require verbal components or the utterance of words of power.

- **Distract / Confound** (increase cast time / cooldown)

  This effect reduces the target’s casting efficiency. Casting times and cooldown periods are increased, and there is an elevated chance for spells to fizzle or fail.

- **Sunder** (reduce magical defenses)

  This effect diminishes the target's magical defenses, causing magical damage to be mitigated to a lesser degree.

### Counter Player Control

- **Fear** (uncontrollable, run away)

  This effect causes the player to lose control of their avatar, which then moves in a direction away from the caster, often in a panic.

- **Panic** (uncontrollable, move at random)

  This effect results in the player losing control of their avatar, which then moves about in random directions, potentially into danger.

- **Charm** (take control of another unit)

  This effect transfers control of the player's avatar to the caster. The player can see what their avatar is doing but cannot influence its actions.

## Psionics

### Overview

Psionics is a distinct form of magic that relies on innate mental abilities rather than external components, incantations, or traditional magical energies. Practitioners of psionics, known as psions, harness the power of their minds to influence the physical world, manipulate elements, and interact with other minds.

### Limitations and Training

Psionic abilities demand intense mental discipline and focus. Practitioners often engage in rigorous meditation and mental exercises to enhance their cognitive capacities and control. Overexertion can lead to mental fatigue, physical exhaustion, or unintended side effects. Psions must also be cautious of ethical considerations, especially when manipulating other minds or life forms.

## Cantrips

### Overview

Cantrips are simple spells that can be cast by anyone with sufficient intelligence and basic magical training.
