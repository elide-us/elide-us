## ECHO GRID – PROLOGUE
Setting: 2040s. The Constitutional Convention of the Harmony Age.
Location: The Great Lakes Civic Forum, a circular, open-air parliament hall built on top of a repurposed rail interchange. The air is quiet. Everything feels too calm.

### PAGE 1
(Wide panel. A panoramic view of the forum, surrounded by natural growth and glass-and-wood infrastructure. Delegates in colored robes, patterned with guild marks, stand along stepped platforms. In the center: a teenager in ceremonial dress stands beside a hovering AI interface.)

#### CAPTION (NARRATOR):

In every age, we believed we were the last to inherit the mess.

#### CAPTION:

But this time...
We might actually clean it up.

### PAGE 2
(Two narrow panels, side-by-side. First: a close-up of the AI—smooth, semi-organic, light patterns flowing through it like breath. Second: the teen, Kirin, eyes downcast, hand hovering over a neural tablet.)

#### ECHO (AI):

The Council’s aligned. The amendment passes on signature.

#### KIRIN:

And then?

#### ECHO:

Then… we remember how it broke.
And why we needed to fix it.

### PAGE 3
(A full-page, grayscale panel transition. A zoomed-in still of Kirin’s eyes, overlayed with fragmented data, faces, protest footage, node failures. The image of Clara appears, embedded in a projected “Archive of Civic Builders.”)

#### CAPTION (ECHO):

Before MeshID.
Before the Consensus Chain.
Before the Code Wars and the Collapse...
There was only a woman. A keyboard.
And the first lie too dangerous to ignore.

### PAGE 4
(We land in 1970s Rust River. Industrial dusk. Wires crisscrossed over sunlit rails. The air hums with static and machine heat. Clara, younger, leans over a terminal in a trailer lined with server racks and shelves of code manuals.)

#### CAPTION:

Year: 1974. The beginning of the Civic Grid. The day Clara Two-Feathers pressed Enter.

FSNA Constitutional Convention Address, 2040s
Delivered before passage of the Civic Information Integrity Amendment.

#### SPEAKER: MIREYA QUINN
Archivist-General of the FSNA Council of Memory.

“Let it be recorded.”

“Not merely passed, not merely enacted.
Let this amendment be remembered.”

“Because this was the age when we nearly forgot who we were.”

“We, who believed the truth would travel faster than the lie.
We, who built the mesh to connect—but not to care."

"We, who placed our memories in stone, but let our meanings drift like smoke.”

“Let this be our repair.”

“The Civic Information Integrity Amendment does not enforce belief.
It does not punish disagreement.
It does not silence voices.”

“It restores consequence.
It reattaches words to their weight.”

“Because speech is a thread in the civic weave,
and a thread cut carelessly can unravel a nation.”

“Let it be understood.”

“That this world was not saved by heroes.
Not by kings, not by martyrs, not by violence.”

“It was saved by people who chose to stay in the room.
Who chose to explain.
To wait.
To listen.
To write the code again, better.
To show their receipts."

"To say: This is what I believe, and this is why.”

“Let this be the last amendment we need for a generation.”

“And let us now remember the generation who first tried to build a world worth speaking in.”

(Final panel: Kirin closes their eyes. Echo hovers behind. A bright, digital glyph—part truth signature, part tribal symbol—burns into a marble tablet beside the others.)

#### ECHO:

Signature confirmed.
The Civic Weave is whole.
