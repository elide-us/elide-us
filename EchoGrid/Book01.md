## ECHO GRID – PROLOGUE
Setting: 2040s. The Constitutional Convention of the Harmony Age.
Location: The Great Lakes Civic Forum, a circular, open-air parliament hall built on top of a repurposed rail interchange. The air is quiet. Everything feels too calm.

### PAGE 1
(Wide panel. A panoramic view of the forum, surrounded by natural growth and glass-and-wood infrastructure. Delegates in colored robes, patterned with guild marks, stand along stepped platforms. In the center: a teenager in ceremonial dress stands beside a hovering AI interface.)

#### CAPTION (NARRATOR):

In every age, we believed we were the last to inherit the mess.

#### CAPTION:

But this time...
We might actually clean it up.

### PAGE 2
(Two narrow panels, side-by-side. First: a close-up of the AI—smooth, semi-organic, light patterns flowing through it like breath. Second: the teen, Kirin, eyes downcast, hand hovering over a neural tablet.)

#### ECHO (AI):

The Council’s aligned. The amendment passes on signature.

#### KIRIN:

And then?

#### ECHO:

Then… we remember how it broke.
And why we needed to fix it.

### PAGE 3
(A full-page, grayscale panel transition. A zoomed-in still of Kirin’s eyes, overlayed with fragmented data, faces, protest footage, node failures. The image of Clara appears, embedded in a projected “Archive of Civic Builders.”)

#### CAPTION (ECHO):

Before MeshID.
Before the Consensus Chain.
Before the Code Wars and the Collapse...
There was only a woman. A keyboard.
And the first lie too dangerous to ignore.

### PAGE 4
(We land in 1970s Rust River. Industrial dusk. Wires crisscrossed over sunlit rails. The air hums with static and machine heat. Clara, younger, leans over a terminal in a trailer lined with server racks and shelves of code manuals.)

#### CAPTION:

Year: 1974. The beginning of the Civic Grid. The day Clara Two-Feathers pressed Enter.

FSNA Constitutional Convention Address, 2040s
Delivered before passage of the Civic Information Integrity Amendment.

#### SPEAKER: MIREYA QUINN
Archivist-General of the FSNA Council of Memory.

“Let it be recorded.”

“Not merely passed, not merely enacted.
Let this amendment be remembered.”

“Because this was the age when we nearly forgot who we were.”

“We, who believed the truth would travel faster than the lie.
We, who built the mesh to connect—but not to care."

"We, who placed our memories in stone, but let our meanings drift like smoke.”

“Let this be our repair.”

“The Civic Information Integrity Amendment does not enforce belief.
It does not punish disagreement.
It does not silence voices.”

“It restores consequence.
It reattaches words to their weight.”

“Because speech is a thread in the civic weave,
and a thread cut carelessly can unravel a nation.”

“Let it be understood.”

“That this world was not saved by heroes.
Not by kings, not by martyrs, not by violence.”

“It was saved by people who chose to stay in the room.
Who chose to explain.
To wait.
To listen.
To write the code again, better.
To show their receipts."

"To say: This is what I believe, and this is why.”

“Let this be the last amendment we need for a generation.”

“And let us now remember the generation who first tried to build a world worth speaking in.”

(Final panel: Kirin closes their eyes. Echo hovers behind. A bright, digital glyph—part truth signature, part tribal symbol—burns into a marble tablet beside the others.)

#### ECHO:

Signature confirmed.
The Civic Weave is whole.

## ECHO GRID - CHAPTER 1

Panel 3:
Wide shot—Lian still in the archive, looking at the fractured trust map like a battlefield. One blinking node—Eli-TF.07—still pulses faintly.

#### LIAN (to self):

The ledger never forgets.
But memory... needs maintenance.

Panel 2:
Sera walks toward the exit, pausing.

#### SERA:

Clara saw this coming.
Jules documented it.
And Eli lived it.

### PAGE 5

Panel 1:
Sera stands up, pushing aside old drives. Determined now.

#### SERA:

We find him.
We tell him.

#### LIAN:

If he’s even still alive.

Panel 3:
They sit in silence. A blinking cursor on a forgotten screen stares back.

#### SERA (quiet):

He never had a chance.

Panel 2:
Lian blinks. This is the moment the system breaks in front of them.

#### LIAN:

They injected the dispatch before the routing table stabilized.

#### SERA:

They led the quorum before quorum existed.

### PAGE 6

Panel 1:
Lian overlays a cross-reference timestamp.

#### LIAN:

But this node wasn’t even online two minutes earlier.

#### SERA:

And that signature? It precedes the route activation.

Panel 3:
Sera highlights a string:
OPERATOR: ELI-TF.07
COMMAND: EXECUTE GATE C
ORIGIN: RS-M5 > NY-C3 > RR-12
SIGNATURE: STAMPED

#### SERA:

This is the record they used to convict him.

Panel 2:
A screen loads. A half-broken node graph appears—data sharded across multiple nodes, incomplete quorum records, outdated keys.

#### LIAN:

These aren’t hash-linked. This is pre-consensus.

#### SERA:

That means it’s mutable.
But it also means we can read the raw messages.

#### SERA:

Why would this be backed up off-path?

#### LIAN:

Because someone thought it might be important…
And someone else didn’t want it to be useful.

### PAGE 7

Panel 1:
Sera clicks a buried folder: /deprecated/mesh_redundant/echo_subtrees.bak

#### SCREEN:

WARNING: UNVERIFIED CHAIN ACCESS
Continue? [Y/N]

Panel 3:
Close-up of an old node route map—a branching tree of trust flows. One branch labeled RS-M5 is marked red, but the log is incomplete.

#### SERA:

Look. RS-M5 isn’t listed as a lead node in the public chain.
But it was for fifteen minutes.

#### LIAN:

Long enough to sign a false dispatch.

Panel 2:
Sera scrolls through an outdated GUI with missing fonts. Files are misnamed, partially rendered, and full of protocol tags from deprecated node software.

#### SERA:

How did anyone use this?

#### LIAN:

Poorly.
Which is why it worked.

#### SERA:

According to the civic chain index, Eli’s transaction is fully verified.

#### LIAN (dry):

According to the civic chain index, I was born in three places and died in two.

### PAGE 8

Panel 1:
*A dusty, analog-heavy subnode. A flickering projector screen showing fragmentary node paths. Sera is hunched over a terminal. Lian is unpacking physical drives and old meshkeys from a metal lockbox labeled “UNSORTED / PRECHAIN / UNVERIFIED.”

## ECHO GRID – Thread B, Chapter 2: "Subpaths"

Setting: Civic Mesh Archive Node 17-B — Obsolete system gateway
Time: Four weeks after their last conversation with the council

### PAGE 9 – Silent Panel

Eli sits alone in the control room. Emergency lights still flashing. One red light stays solid:
LOCK: TERMINAL QUARANTINED

#### CAPTION:

The logs were clean.
The process was followed.
The system spoke.

#### CAPTION 2:

And no one heard him.

Panel 4:
Clara’s eyes blink open. Blurred vision. A coworker crouches over her, blood on their temple.

#### CLARA (weakly):

What... happened?

Panel 3:
A faint voice.

#### OFF-PANEL:

Clara? Clara, can you hear me?

Panel 2:
Clara, unconscious on the floor. Rubble around her. Light flickers.

#### NEW OFFICER:

Eli Two-Feathers is locked to the action. No override trail.
He’s the operator on record.

#### DISPATCHER (cold):

Call the tribunal.

### PAGE 10

Panel 1:
Back in the emergency hub. Another officer steps in. The screen behind them flashes:
“CASCADE EVENT – INJURIES REPORTED – INFRASTRUCTURE LOSS: SEVERE”

Panel 3:
A blinking indicator reads:
RECORDING – Local node buffer
ARCHIVE: TEMPORARY – Non-primary quorum

#### ELI (into recorder):

Timestamp 20:48.
This is Eli Two-Feathers.
Request ID 44-ARC-992 was not initiated by me.
I was logged in, but did not authorize -
The system confirmed a false origin.

Panel 2:
Close-up on Eli, breathing hard. Lowering the phone. He presses the RECORD button on his terminal’s private journal feed.

### PAGE 11

Panel 1:
Eli stares into his terminal. The log shows his name. Signature verified. Timestamp matched to the exact second of execution.

#### SCREEN:
EXECUTED BY: ELI-TF.07
CHAIN ORIGIN: RS-M5 > NY-C3 > RR-12
STATUS: CONTEXT VERIFIED

Panel 3:
Eli flinches like he’s been slapped. But he’s already scrolling through logs on his terminal—trying to find the breach.

#### ELI:

I never hit Execute. I was reviewing the request—then it triggered.
I was hovering over DENY when it—disappeared.

Panel 2:
Cut to: Operations Coordination Hub. A Civic Officer, early 40s, headset on, glaring at their monitor.

#### OFFICER (shouting):

That gate override came from your console.
You opened a reservoir path into a live flood zone.

### PAGE 12

Panel 1:
Interior – Control Room. Lights strobing. Eli grabs the old-style emergency comm handset from the wall. His hands are shaking.

#### ELI:

Emergency dispatch, this is Eli Two-Feathers. Operator ID 07. We've got a cascade—unauthorized gate release on Grid C.

## ECHO GRID – Thread A, Chapter 3: "False Origin"

Setting: Rust River Civic Water Control Facility — Emergency Coordination Office
Time: Immediately after the blast

#### CAPTION (next page):

The system worked as designed.
It just trusted the wrong voice.

### PAGE 13

Full-page splash panel.

Clara rounds the corner to the substation corridor. A pressure blast rips from the pipework in the ceiling-a shockwave slams into her mid-run. The tablet flies from her hand. Lights burst.
Her body arcs through the air, silhouetted against a wall of heat and sound.

Panel 4:
*Eli stands now, backlit by warning strobes. A low, growing rumble starts beneath the floor. He looks up—fear dawning.

Panel 3:
Clara hits the stairwell hard, descending two floors at full speed.

Panel 2:
Eli looks at the control panel-now blinking red.

#### ALERT:
EMERGENCY RELEASE – GATE C OPENED
OPERATOR: ELI TWO-FEATHERS – CONFIRMED

### PAGE 14

Panel 1:
Clara slams the tablet down, bolts from her chair, sprinting through the corridor. Techs shout as she shoves past.

Panel 3:
*Eli’s screen flickers-the transaction disappears.

#### SCREEN:
STATUS: EXECUTED – NODE RESPONSE ACKNOWLEDGED

#### ELI:

What?! I didn't-
I didn't click-

Panel 2:
*Clara's hand clutches her mouth. Her eyes bulge. She stares at the trust path—the entire quorum chain is valid.

#### CLARA:

No no no-NO-

### PAGE 15

Panel 1:
Back to Eli. He scrolls down the packet. Cursor hovers over DENY.

#### ELI (aloud):

I didn't send this.

Panel 4:
Clara clicks the file open. Her face slackens as she reads the origin header:
VERIFIED NODE: NY-C3 / LEAD: RS-M5 / SOURCE ID: ELI-TF.07

Panel 3:
Eli reads the incoming request log.

#### ELI (thinking):

“Reservoir gate adjustment – upstream flow override…”
Wait. This isn’t a test packet.

Panel 2:
Clara is alone in a cramped diagnostics room, hair tied back, eyes red from lack of sleep. She opens her inbox.

#### SCREEN:
NEW – MESH TRACE LOG: FROM ELI TWO-FEATHERS

### PAGE 16

Panel 1:
Eli sits at a dusty, over-lit terminal in a quiet room filled with analog screens and node routers. Rain taps on a narrow window. He yawns, logs into the console.

#### ELI (muttering):

Alright. Let’s see what you weirdos did this time.
