## ECHO GRID – PROLOGUE
Setting: 2040s. The Constitutional Convention of the Harmony Age.
Location: The Great Lakes Civic Forum, a circular, open-air parliament hall built on top of a repurposed rail interchange. The air is quiet. Everything feels too calm.

### PAGE 1
(Wide panel. A panoramic view of the forum, surrounded by natural growth and glass-and-wood infrastructure. Delegates in colored robes, patterned with guild marks, stand along stepped platforms. In the center: a teenager in ceremonial dress stands beside a hovering AI interface.)

#### CAPTION (NARRATOR):

In every age, we believed we were the last to inherit the mess.

#### CAPTION:

But this time...
We might actually clean it up.

### PAGE 2
(Two narrow panels, side-by-side. First: a close-up of the AI—smooth, semi-organic, light patterns flowing through it like breath. Second: the teen, Kirin, eyes downcast, hand hovering over a neural tablet.)

#### ECHO (AI):

The Council’s aligned. The amendment passes on signature.

#### KIRIN:

And then?

#### ECHO:

Then… we remember how it broke.
And why we needed to fix it.
